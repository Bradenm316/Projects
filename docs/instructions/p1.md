# Project 1: Software Requirements Specification Document

This serves as a template for each projects' Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. When filling this out, you will be required to create user stories, use cases, requirements, and a glossary of terms relevant to your project. Each group member must contribute to every section, so it is crucial that your group's GitHub repository shows a commit history that reflects the work of each group member. It is highly recommended that you create separate branches for each member, but since this is one single document, you will need to manually merge the branches together. It is also advisable to have multiple working versions of this document (named separately) so that one person can compile the final SRS document from the multiple working versions. Ultimately, how you go about managing this is up to you, but consistent formatting, clear commit messages, and a thorough commit history with contributions from each group member are required.

Fill the document out following the guidelines listed in each section. Maintain [proper Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## Introduction

In this section, you should give a brief overview of what your project will be. Describe the software system you are building and what problems it solves. You should also give a short description of the stakeholders (users of the system) and what their needs are. There is no set formatting requirement, but you should maintain a consistent structure across future sections. Not all members must contribute to this section.

The goal of this project is to create an online store for a small business that specializes in personalized cakes. Customers will be able to browse and order cakes with customized flavors, decorations, and sizes at the store. The system will also enable the business owner to manage orders, inventory, and payments. The stakeholders are the business owner, who wants to sell their cakes online, and the clients, who want to order personalized cakes that fit their needs. - Jemina

## Constraints

In this section, you should list any constraints that you have for the project. Each group member must supply at least two constraints. These can be constraints on the project itself, the software system, or the stakeholders. Constraints can be anything that limits the scope of the project.

Constraints can also be things like the required timeline of the project. Be creative.

1. The online store must be easy to use for both customers and the business owner, with a simple and intuitive interface. - Jemina
2. To protect client data, the online store must be hosted on a secure server and use encryption. - Jemina
